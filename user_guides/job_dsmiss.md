## Dismiss Job
The easiest way to delete a job is to view it on the `Jobs` pane and click the `Delete Job` button.

Dismissing a job is to stop a job that is currently running already.  To dismiss a job, go to `Command Palette` -> `DPS` -> `Dismiss DPS Job`.  A popup will appear, prompting the user to enter the job id.
