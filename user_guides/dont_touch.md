# What Not to Do!

We tried to use as many out of the box technologies as possible in this project to get as many features
available as possible. But with that comes a lot of features that are not relevant to our platform or 
have not been implemented on our side yet. As we continue to build MAAP this list should become shorter
and shorter, but for now here are the things that you should not mess with. 

If you happen to mess with one of these things, you'll probably be fine - you'll just end up with a bunch
of errors you don't understand or just nothing happening when you click a button.
