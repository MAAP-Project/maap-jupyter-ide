# Workspaces

## Creating workspaces

Navigate to the side panel tab `Workspaces` and click `Add Workspace`. Name your workspace, choose your
stack and the amount of RAM you will need. **_Make sure you pay close attention to the Organization you start the
workspace in. This is something that cannot be changed, and will affect who you are able to share the workspace
with!_** (more info [here](./sharing.md)).

If you want to add a git [project](./projects.md), you may do this when creating the workspace, or add after creation.

### Choosing a stack

There are many stack options that are defaults of Eclipse Che, but in order to use the custom MAAP jupyter interface,
please select the stack `maap-jupyter-ide`.

## Sharing workspaces

See documentation on [sharing](./sharing.md).
