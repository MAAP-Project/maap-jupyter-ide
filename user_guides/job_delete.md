## Delete Job

The easiest way to delete a job is to view it on the `Jobs` pane and click the `Delete Job` button.

Deleting a job means removing any record of a job that has already been attempted and failed or completed.  To delete a job, go to `Command Palette` -> `DPS` -> `Delete DPS Job`.  Similar to `Get Status` and `Get Results`, a popup will appear, prompting the user to enter the job id.
