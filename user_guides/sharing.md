# Sharing

## Organizations

We are utilizing Eclipse Cheâ€™s Organizations feature to allow users to share workspaces 
with other MAAP users. If a workspace is created in an organization, a user can easily
share that workspace with other members of the organization. 

#### All users are in one shared organization

Users can be in multiple organizations, but there is one organization, called `maap-users` that
all users are in. This allows for users to be able to see all the possible MAAP users to
share with.

#### All users have their own personal organization they can customize

Users all also have their own personal organization. Each user is the admin of their
own organization so they can easily curate groups and individuals that they share their
work with often. 

To add a user to your personal organization, use the `Add Member` button. Now you can share
any workspace in your personal organization with them!

To create a group of users you want to share with, create a sub-organization in your
personal organization. In order to add someone to your sub-organization, you first must
add them to your personal organization. Organizations can be created in layers of
nesting sub-organizations, but for all organizations, you can only add members of
it's parent organization.

As you can see, your personal organization is really just a sub-organization of 
`maap-users`/

For example - if I wanted to create a group frequent collaborators of mine. 
1. Add each of them to my personal organization `maap-users\<my-name-here>`.
2. Create a sub-organization under `maap-users\<my-name-here>`, lets's call it
`maap-users\<my-name-here>\my-collaborators`.
3. Add each of my collaborators to my new sub-organization.


#### Creating workspaces in an organization's namespace

All workspaces are created under the namespace of an organization.
**NOTE: Once a workspace is created under an organization it cannot be moved to a 
different organization.**

To specify which organization you want a workspace to be a part of, specify using the
dropdown on workspace creation.

Once a workspace is created, it is not inherent that all memebers of that organization
are able to see it. You must share with them after it is created. This can be found in
workspace's `Share` tab.

#### More documentation
For more documentation help on using organizations, check out Che's 
[guide](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-6/organizations.html). It is not specific
to MAAP's implementation, but most of the info will still apply!

*TODO:*  Add info here about shared s3 directories once those are implemented
