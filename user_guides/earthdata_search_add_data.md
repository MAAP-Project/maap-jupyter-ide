## Adding data to a notebook

Once you have selected the data that you want to work with, it's time to transfer that
information to a notebook. There are 2 options for this - you can either insert a search
query, or the results of that query (a list of links to the data) to your notebook.

To choose and insert, select an option in the dropdown menu:

In order to run the search command, and make other helpful calls for interacting
with the data, you need to have the MAAP library ([maap-py](https://github.com/MAAP-Project/maap-py)) 
imported into your notebook. On the notebook toolbar there is a helpful button that will insert all 
the MAAP defaults.
