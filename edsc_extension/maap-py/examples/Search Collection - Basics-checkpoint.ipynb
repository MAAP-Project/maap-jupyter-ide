      "Short Name: GPM_2AGPROFTRMMTMI_CLIM_TEST\nDataset ID: GPM TMI (GPROF) Climate-based Radiometer Precipitation Profiling L2A 1.5 hours 13 km V04 (GPM_2AGPROFTRMMTMI_CLIM) at GES DISC\nArchive Center: NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC\nDescription: The \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.nnThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:n+ TMI (TRMM)n+ GMI, (GPM)n+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)n+ MHS (METOP A,B)n+ ATMS (NPP)n+ SAPHIR (MT1)nnThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.nnThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-180.0', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '90.0', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '180.0', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '-90.0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: gpmpersucifld\nDataset ID: GPM Ground Validation Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) IFloodS V1\nArchive Center: NASA/MSFC/GHRC\nDescription: The GPM Ground Validation Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) IFloodS dataset is a subset from the global 30-minute PERSIANN-CCS files generated in near-real time selected for the time period of the GPM Ground Validation Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS) field campaign. The main goal of IFloodS were to collect detailed measurements of precipitation at the Earthu2019s surface using ground instruments and advanced weather radars and to simultaneously collect data from satellites passing overhead.

It replaces the old TRMM_2A21,2A23,2A25nVersion 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.nnThis is the new, GPM-like, format for TRMM Precipitation Radar L2 data that now incorporates what was known as 2A21, 2A23 and 2A25 datasets.nnThe primary purpose of 2A21 is to compute the path-integrated attenuation (PIA) using the surface reference technique (SRT). The surface reference technique rests on the assumption that the difference between the measurements of the normalized surface cross section outside and within the rain provides an estimate of the PIA. The secondary purpose of 2A21 is to compute the normalized radar cross sections (\"sigma-not\" or Normalized Radar Cross-Sectin (NRTS)) of the surface under rain-free conditions. nnMain objectives of 2A23 are as follows:n(a) Detection of bright band (BB) and determination of the height of BB, thenstrength of BB, and the width (i.e. thickness) of BB when BB exists.n(b) Classification of rain type into the following three categories:n- stratiform,n - convective,n - other,nwhere \"other\" means (ice) cloud only and/or maybe noise.n (c) Detection of shallow isolated and shallow non-isolated.n (d) Output of Rain/No-rain flag.n (e) Computation of the estimated height of freezing level.n (f) Output of the height of storm top. nnThe objectives of 2A25 are to correct for the rain attenuation in measured radar reflectivity (Zm) and to estimate the instantaneous three-dimensional distribution of rain from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data. The estimated vertical profiles of attenuation-corrected radar reflectivity factor (Ze) and rainfall rate (R) are given at each resolution cell of the PR. The estimated rainfall rate at the actual surface height and the average rainfall rate between the two predefined altitudes (2 and 4 km) are also calculated for each beam position.nnChanges in horizontal resolution resulting from the TRMM boost that occurred on 24 August 2001:nnPre-Boost (before 7 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 91.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 215 km; Horizontal Resolution: 4.3 km nnPost-Boost (after 24 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 92.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 247 km; Horizontal Resolution: 5.0 km\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-180.0', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '38.0', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '180.0', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '-38.0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: gpmtrm2A25iphx\nDataset ID: GPM Ground Validation TRMM 2A25 NRT Precipitation Radar IPHEx V7\nArchive Center: NASA/MSFC/GHRC\nDescription: The GPM Ground Validation TRMM 2A25 NRT Precipitation Radar IPHEx data are estimates of instantaneous three-dimensional distribution of rain from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR).

This dataset aggregated observations from each of the TRMM instruments for each satellite orbit that was coincident with a tropical cyclone in any of the six TC-prone ocean basins. These swath data were co-located and subsetted to a 20-degree longitude by 20-degree latitude bounding box centered on the tropical storm, which is typically large enough to observe the various sizes of TCs and their immediate environments. The TCPF Level 1 dataset was created by researchers at Florida International University (FIU) and the University of Utah (UU) from the UU TRMM Precipitation Feature database. The TCPF database was built by extracting those precipitation features that are identified as tropical cyclones (TC) using the TC best-track data provided by National Hurricane Center or the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-179.98', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '39.11', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '179.98', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '-39.14'}\n================================================\nShort Name: WC_MULTISEN_PREC_025\nDataset ID: TMI/TRMM precipitation and uncertainty (TMPA) L3 3 hour 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree V001 (WC_MULTISEN_PREC_025) at GES DISC\nArchive Center: NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC\nDescription: TMI/TRMM precipitation and uncertainty (TMPA) L3 3 hour 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree V001 provides estimates of accumulated precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Other Data Precipitation Data Set (TRMM 3B42; Huffman et al., 2007), along with estimates of the uncertainty in the TRMM 3B42 made by Bytheway and Kummerow (2013).

It has a downward looking antenna that performs cross track scans. Additional features include: simultaneous dual-frequency, matched beam operation at 13.4 and 35.6 GHz (same as GPM Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar), simultaneous measurement of both like- and cross-polarized signals at both frequencies, Doppler operation, and real-time pulse compression (calibrated reflectivity data can be produced for large areas in the field during flight, if necessary). The APR-2 flew on the NASA DC-8 for the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) experiment and collected data between Aug 17, 2010 - Sep 22, 2010 and are in HDF-4 format. The major goal was to better understand how tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes. NASA used the DC-8 aircraft, the WB-57 aircraft and the Global Hawk Unmanned Airborne System (UAS), configured with a suite of in situ and remote sensing instruments that were used to observe and characterize the lifecycle of hurricanes.\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-100', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '40', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '-71.5', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: namapr2\nDataset ID: NAMMA SECOND GENERATION AIRBORNE PRECIPITATION RADAR (APR-2) V1\nArchive Center: NASA/MSFC/GHRC\nDescription: The NAMMA Second Generation Airborne Precipitation Radar (APR-2) dataset was collected by using the Second Generation Airborne Precipitation Radar (APR-2), which is a dual-frequency (14 GHz and 35 GHz), Doppler, dual-polarization radar system that includes digital, real-time pulse compression, extremely compact RF electronics, and a large deployable dual-frequency cylindrical parabolic antenna subsystem. This system measures radar reflectivity and doppler velocity at both the Ku- and Ka-band. These data files were generated during support of the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (NAMMA) campaign, a field research investigation sponsored by the Science Mission Directorate of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This mission was based in the Cape Verde Islands, 350 miles off the coast of Senegal in west Africa.

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This precipitation estimate from AIRS is using TOVS-like algorithm, and is intended for merging into the precipitation product of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The precipitation estimate from AIRS Level 2 Support product, which are 6-min swath granules (240 per day) are combined here into one daily \"Level 2G\" global grid with dimensions (24x1440x720). Thus every hour is a \"layer\", and the resulting grid cell size is 0.25 degree (~25 km). Thus the grid size is made to fit TRMM products. Since AIRS precipitation is retrieved at AMSU footprint resolution, which is about 45 km at nadir, many grid cells in this 0.25-deg grid are \"empty\".

The ECMWF model was run for two Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) campaigns conducted in Rondonia, Brazil, during January and February of 1999: the Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). See Silva Dias et al.,(2002) for additional information regarding the WETAMAC and TRMM campaigns.

The GPCC simultaneously contributes to the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and other international research and climate monitoring projects. This rain gauge-only data set was acquired from GPCC and resampled to 0.5 degree grid boxes for use in the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II. The GPCC collects precipitation data which are locally observed at rain gauge stations and distributed as CLIMAT and SYNOP reports via the Global Telecommunication System of the World Weather Watch (GTS) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

The analyses are defined by interpolating station observations from GTS (Global Telecommunications System) gauges using the algorithm of Shepard (1968). The algorithm of Shepard (1968) has been widely used to interpolate gauge observations of monthly, pentad, and daily precipitation (Rudolf 1993, Xie et al. 1996). This algorithm is used to interpolate the irregularly distributed station observations onto grid points. The weighting coefficients are inversely proportional to the gauge-grid point distance and are adjusted by a cosine function taking into account the directional isolation of each gauge relative to all other nearby gauges.

The precipitation estimates follow the method of Spencer (1993).  Oceanic precipitation is estimated by increased warming in MSU channel 1 over a threshold. The increased warming is attributable to emission by liquid water in the lower troposphere. MSU channels 2 and 3 are used to remove warming due to air mass differences. The MSU instruments measure the thermal emission of radiation by molecular oxygen at four frequencies near 60 GHz.\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-180.0', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '60.0', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '180.0', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '-60.0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: BOREAS_TF02TFLX_515\nDataset ID: BOREAS TF-02 SSA-OA Tower Flux, Meteorological, and Precipitation Data\nArchive Center: ORNL_DAAC\nDescription: Energy, carbon dioxide, water vaport, and momentum flux data collected above the canopy and in profiles through the canopy, along with meteorological data at the BOREAS SSA-OA site.

A global climatology of mean monthly precipitation was developed using traditional land-based gauge measurements as well as extrapolations of oceanic precipitation from coastal and island observations. Data were obtained from a variety of source archives. These data were screened for coding errors, merged, and redundant stations were removed. The resulting data base contains 24,635 independent terrestrial station records and 2223 oceanic gridpoint estimates.n      n      Precipitation gauge catches, however, are known to underestimate actual precipitation. Errors in the gauge catch result from wind-field deformation above the orifice of the gauge, wetting losses, and evaporation from the gauge and amount globally to nearly 8, 2, and 1 percent of the catch, respectively. A procedure was developed to estimate these errors and was used to obtain better estimates of global precipitation. Spatial variations in gauge type, air temperature, wind speed, and natural vegetation have been interpolated to the nodes of a 0.5 degrees of latitude by 0.5 degrees of longitude lattice using a spherically-based interpolation algorithm.n      n      The data set is used to validate general circulation model simulations of the present-day precipitation climate, for ground-based comparison with satellite-derived precipitation estimates, and as a basis for global water balance studies.\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-180.0', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '90.0', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '180.0', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '-90.0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: RAIN_JAEGER\nDataset ID: Jaeger Monthly Mean Global Precipitation 2.5 x 5.0 degree V1 (RAIN_JEAGER) at GES DISC\nArchive Center: NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC\nDescription: The Jaeger Surface Rain Gauge Observations data set consists of gridded mean monthly global precipitation values for 1931 to 1960 over the continents and 1955 to 1965 over the oceans. nnIn order to calculate monthly, seasonal, and annual variations of precipitation over the whole globe, both hemispheres, and various meridional zones, a gridding technique was used on data spanning 1931 ton1960 over the continents, and 1955 to 1965 over the oceans. For the continental regions, the grid point values were obtained as eye estimates from isopleth maps prepared from up-to-date climatic atlases containing annual and monthly rainfall values, supplemented by other data sets.nAlthough it was initially intended to use data for the standard period 1931-1960, this did not prove possible for all regions.nnMoller's (1951) method for estimating rainfall frequencies was adopted to provide ocean precipitation data. Monthly percentage frequencies were extracted from the mapped isolines of the US Marine Climatic Atlas (US Naval Weather Service 1955-1965) and interpolated to the grid points. After re-expressing the monthly frequencies as annual percentages, the values were scaled to rainfall depth units using Geiger's (1965) precipitation map to yield monthly precipitation means.\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-180.0', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '90.0', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '180.0', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '-90.0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: gpmopassolyx\nDataset ID: GPM Ground Validation Composite Satellite Overpasses OLYMPEX V4\nArchive Center: NASA/MSFC/GHRC\nDescription: The GPM Ground Validation Composite Satellite Overpasses OLYMPEX dataset provides brightness temperature, precipitation, and total column water vapor estimates from multiple satellite overpasses including DMSP F16-19, GCOM-W1, GPM, MetOp, NOAA, and NPP for the OLYMPEX field campaign.

The MACTWP_mean field can also be used as a quality-control screen for the MACLWP_mean field as discussed in Elsaesser et al. (2017), where uncertainty increases as the ratio of cloud to total water path increases.  The MAC-LWP algorithm uses as input the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) Version 7 0.25 degree-resolution retrieval products (produced using the SSM/I, AMSR-E, TMI, AMSR-2, GMI, SSMIS, and WindSat satellite sensors), and performs a bias correction on all input RSS cloud water path products based on AMSR-E matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes.  The MAC-LWP algorithm ensures that spurious trends and variability in the cloud fields arising from drifting satellite overpass times are mitigated by simultaneously solving for the monthly average cloud and total water paths and monthly-mean diurnal cycles, as discussed in O&#8217;Dell et al.

TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.  The precipitation-relevant instruments on the TRMM satellite include the Precipitation Radar (PR), an electronically scanning radar operating at 13.8 GHz; TRMM Microwave Image (TMI), a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer; and Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS), a five-channel visible/infrared radiometer.nnThe purpose of the 3B42 algorithm is to produce TRMM- and raingauge-adjusted multi-satellite precipitation rate (in mm/hr) and root-mean-square (RMS) precipitation-error estimates.  The algorithm combines multiple independent precipitation estimates from the TMI, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing Systems (AMSR-E), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS), and microwave-adjusted merged geo-infrared (IR).  All input microwave data are intercalibrated to TRMM Combined Instrument (TCI) precipitation estimates (TRMM product 3B31); the IR estimates are computed using monthly matched microwave-IR histogram matching; then missing data in individual 3-hourly merged-microwave fields are filled with the IR estimates.  After the preprocessing is complete, the 3-hourly multi-satellite fields are summed for the month and combined with the monthly accumulated Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) rain gauge analysis using inverse-error-variance weighting to form a monthly best-estimate precipitation rate, which is TRMM Product 3B43.  The final step is to scale all the 3-hourly estimates for the month to sum to the monthly value (for each gridbox separately).  The final 3B42 precipitation (innmm/hr) estimates have a 3-hourly temporal resolution and a 0.25?x0.25? spatial resolution.  The spatial coverage is the latitude band 50?S to 50?N.nnImportant Changes: After the initial Version 7 processing, it was discovered that AMSU data were neglected in the first retrospective processing of both the Version 7 TMPA (3B42/43) and TMPA-RT (3B40/41/42RT) data series, which created an important shortcoming in the inventory of microwave precipitation estimates used during 2000-2010. In addition, a coding error in the TMPA-RT replaced the occasional missings in product 3B42RT with zeros. Accordingly, both product series were retrospectively processed again. The main impact in both series was to improve the fine-scale patterns of precipitation during 2000-2010 (and for 3B4xRT into late 2012). Averages over progressively larger time/space scales should be progressively less affected. [This is the reason the lack of AMSU went undiscovered; the merger system copes very reasonably with missing data.] Nonetheless, users are urged to switch to the newest Version 7 data sets. The newest runs may be identified by the file names: V.7 3B42/43 suffix of \"7A.HDF\" for January 2000 - September 2010 V.7 3B4xRT suffix of \"7R2.bin\" for 1 March 2000 - 6 November 2012 It continues to be the case that the Version 7 3B42/43 is some 4% higher than the calibrating data set (2B31) over oceans, which is still under study. However, the initial conclusion is that it results from the sampling mismatch between the (very sparse) TCI and the (much denser) microwave constellation. At the large scales this offset seems to be nearly a proportional constant. nnTMPA Restarted with October 2014: On October 07, 2014, routine production ended for the TRMM PR precipitation estimates.  Since PR is no longer available, the TMI/PR combined instrument (TCI) estimates are also no longer available.  As products 3B42/3B43 use the TCI estimates as the satellite calibrator, September 2014 is the last month these products were produced in this way.  In an effort to continue 3B42/3B43 available and usable, the real time TMPA (TMPA-RT) climatological calibrations/adjustments have been adapted for use in the 3B42/3B43.  October 2014 is the first month of the climatologically calibrated/adjusted 3B42/3B43.  Users should note there will be a discontinuity in the record as a result.  Each individual user must determine the most appropriate use of the climatologically calibrated/adjusted 3B42/3B43 products.nnThe two-month latency for 3B42/3B43 remains the same with this new calibration.  The delayed release for October 2014 reflects both development work and a problem with the input IR data.  The previously released \"provisional\" data set is now considered obsolete and should not be used (although in many areas it is identical to this official release).  As well, a (different) problem with the input IR for November 2014 is not yet resolved, so that data set is still in provisional status.  We expect to have updated November 2014 IR data in the very near future, and thereafter run on the usual schedule.nnFor more details, see this document: http://pmm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/imce/3B42_3B43_TMPA_restart.pdfnnnThe daily accumulated (beginning at 00Z and ending at 21Z; unit: mm) rainfall product is derived from this 3-hourly product.

There is no equivalent in the old TRMM suite of products.nnVersion 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.nnEstimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.nnThe method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain typesu2014convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)u2014were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Oceanu2013Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The SLH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.nnBecause observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the SLH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.nn\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-180.0', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '37.0', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '180.0', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '-37.0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: csgcpex01\nDataset ID: GPM GROUND VALIDATION GCPEX SNOW MICROPHYSICS CASE STUDY V1\nArchive Center: NASA/MSFC/GHRC\nDescription: The GPM Ground Validation GCPEX Snow Microphysics Case Study characterizes the 3-D microphysical evolution and distribution of snow in context of the thermodynamic environment observed during the February 24th, 2012 event of the GPM Cold-season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx).

The data set contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.nnGLDAS-2.1 simulation is forced by a combination of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Center for Environmental Prediction&#8217;s Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields, spatially and temporally disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation fields, and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET).  This data set supersedes GLDAS-1 products, in which improvements are made in the use of GPCP and the disaggregation scheme, and quality control for the AGRMET dataset.  The GPCP 1-degree Daily (1DD) dataset is used and disaggregated to 3-hourly intervals, whereas GLDAS-1 used the NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) pentad dataset and disaggregated to 6-hourly.  The gaps and irregularity in the AGRMET shortwave downward flux are alleviated by additional filtering and bias correction to the Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) dataset.  Furthermore, the spatial aggregation scheme of GDAS dataset is revised in GLDAS-2.1.nnThe simulation started on 1 January 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation and was forced with GDAS and the disaggregated GPCP.

The simulation was forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds, 1999), and elevation (GTOPO30).  The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). nnThe main objective for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets using the Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing sources switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which introduced unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997. Other enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching to MODIS based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture over desert.  In the Noah model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.

The data set contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.nnGLDAS-2.1 simulation is forced by a combination of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Center for Environmental Prediction&#8217;s Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields, spatially and temporally disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation fields, and observation based downward shortwave and longwave radiation fields derived using the method of the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET).  This data set supersedes GLDAS-1 products, in which improvements are made in the use of GPCP and the disaggregation scheme, and quality control for the AGRMET dataset.  The GPCP 1-degree Daily (1DD) dataset is used and disaggregated to 3-hourly intervals, whereas GLDAS-1 used the NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) pentad dataset and disaggregated to 6-hourly.  The gaps and irregularity in the AGRMET shortwave downward flux are alleviated by additional filtering and bias correction to the Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) dataset.  Furthermore, the spatial aggregation scheme of GDAS dataset is revised in GLDAS-2.1.nnThe simulation started on 1 January 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation and was forced with GDAS and the disaggregated GPCP.

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is WMO GRIB-1. nnDetails about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing data sets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). nnThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR andnNLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are those employed in NLDAS-1, as presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).nnThe surface downward shortwave radiation field in \"File A\" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in \"File A\" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).nnThe precipitation field in \"File A\" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in \"File A\" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in \"File B\"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.nnThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven fields.  The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. nnFor more information, please see the README Document.\nBounding Rectangle: {'WestBoundingCoordinate': '-125.0', 'NorthBoundingCoordinate': '53.0', 'EastBoundingCoordinate': '-67.0', 'SouthBoundingCoordinate': '25.0'}\n================================================\nShort Name: GLDAS_NOAH10_M\nDataset ID: GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_NOAH10_M) at GES DISC\nArchive Center: NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC\nDescription: Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2) has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). nnThis data set, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree monthly, was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.3, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2010 but will be extended as the data becomes available. nnThe model simulation was initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds, 1999), and elevation (GTOPO30).  The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).nnThe main objective for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets using the Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing sources switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which introduced unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997. Other enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching to MODIS based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture over desert.  In the Noah model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.
