# MAAP Jupyter Interface

This repo includes JupyterLab extensions that have been built for the MAAP project (https://che-k8s.maap.xyz/)

In order to use each of these extensions they must be installed and enabled. Instructions for each extension can be found in the respective folder. 

These extensions have been developed on `Jupyter 4.4.0` and `Jupyter Lab 0.32.1`.

To build additional extensions for the project, it is recommended to start from a [cookie-cutter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts) or off a previouslt built extension.
